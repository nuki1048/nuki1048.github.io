This layout is made according to the course from Udemy (link to the course https://www.udemy.com/course/webdeveloper/) 

❗This layout is not my portfolio, it is a blank for it❗. 
In this project I used HTML, SASS, SCSS, GULP AND JS. 
I used HTML, SCSS and SASS for visuals and markup, as well as for libraries (boostrap -reboot)✨✨.
GULP was used to compress images and to convert scss sass into one file⚠️. 
JS is here only for the hamburger menu⚠️.
